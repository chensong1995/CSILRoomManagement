#Bookings

In the booking system, users can book a room for a particular period. Users can also make batch bookings, for example, one can book a room for 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm every Monday. Calendar GUI and table views are both provided. Users can book a room and manage their booking records. 

##Book a room
Users can choose a room by clicking the corresponding grid. If a grid is yellow, it means the room is under maintenance, while green grids represent available rooms.  Users can check the calendar of every room, but they can only book an available room. 

For each room, the website uses a calendar to display all its booking records. Batch bookings are colored by green, while regular bookings are colored by blue. Users can choose a period and create a booking record. A title is required for each booking. If the user decides to make a batch booking, he must specify a date when this booking starts, a date when this booking ends. The user also has to declare on which days of a week this booking will happen. 

##Manage bookings

Users can check all their bookings through Manage Bookings page. Although Non-administrative users are not allowed to edit their bookings, they can delete their bookings. 

##My Calendar

Our system provides each user with a calendar view. Users can check or delete their bookings through the calendar view if they prefer calendar GUI to the table view.

##Booking management (Admin)
Admin users have the privilege to edit and delete all booking records.

##iCal feed
Our system generates iCal feed for each user. A user can use this iCal feed in their calendar Apps. Our iCal feed supports Google Calendar, iCal, Outlook, etc.
