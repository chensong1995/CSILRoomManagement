# SFU CSIL Room Management System
In CMPT courses at Simon Fraser University, teaching assistants use the "CS TA Room Bookings" system to book rooms for their office hours (http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/tabooking/). This system is obsolete, and we are developing a new system to replace it. This is a course project of CMPT 470 at SFU, instructed by Gregory Baker.
