<h1>The Linux/UNIX Command Line Environment</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div></div>
<div class="text parbase section">

<div class="">
<h2><a name="commandline"></a>What is the Linux/UNIX command line?</h2>
<p>The command line is a text-only interface that allows you to communicate directly with the Unix operating system (O/S). Although it is text-only, the command line is vastly more powerful than the Graphical User Interface (GUI - pronounced "goo-ey") that most Unix users use most of the time. All GUI applications on the Linux system rely heavily on the simple command line level Unix commands when they need to perform input/output of any sort. There are many Unix commands that can affect the O/S and its operation that can have a great deal of impact on the GUI applications but that the GUI user never sees.</p>
<p>Users can access the Unix command line from the GUI, by running an application called "Terminal". You can find this application in your list of applications inside your menus. Linux users also have access to <b>Virtual Consoles</b>. Please read the next <a href="#virtualconsole">Q&amp;A</a> for important instructions.<br>
</p>
<p>We cannot teach you about all of the Unix command line commands in this FAQ. There is extensive help for both new and experienced users alike on the Web.</p>

<div class="">
<h2><a name="virtualconsole"></a>What is the Linux/UNIX Virtual Console?</h2>
<p><b>Virtual Console</b> is the interface that system administrators use for Linux/UNIX systems when installing and repairing the OS, or other times when the graphical interface cannot be used, e.g. diagnose issues regarding login.<br>
</p>
<p>Linux users also have access to Virtual Consoles. There are six Virtual Consoles on each Ubuntu Linux workstation in CSIL, and you invoke them from the keyboard by pressing the key sequence CTRL-ALT-F1 to F6. Pressing CTRL-ALT-F7 will take you back to the GUI session.</p>
<h4><b>CRITICAL:</b></h4>
<p>You MUST log out of each Virtual Console that you login to. Logging out of the GUI session is NOT sufficient. If you logged in to a Virtual Console and did not log out, any other user coming along to your workstation after you had left CSIL would have full access to your account.</p>

<div class="text parbase section">

<div class="">
<h2><a name="shell"></a>What is a command shell?</h2>
<p>A command shell is a program that interprets what you type at the command line, and tries to make sense out of it. There are many different shells, each with its own peculiarities. Some popular ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>sh - the Bourne shell.</li>
<li>csh - the C shell.</li>
<li>tsh - the T shell.</li>
<li>bash - the Bourne-again shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time you log in to a Unix/Linux system, you are starting a shell. This is true even if you only log in to the GUI session. Every Unix user has a default shell, set by the system administrator who created your account. You cannot change this in CSIL, but you can run a sub-shell if you like. At the command line, simply type in the name of the new shell (for example, to invoke the 'bash' shell):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">bash</p>
<p>To exit a sub-shell and return to the parent shell, enter the 'exit' command at the command prompt.</p>
<p>There is extensive documentation on the Web regarding Unix command shells and their features.</p>

<div class="">
<h2><a name="environment"></a>How is my CSIL Linux/UNIX environment set up?</h2>
<p>Your Unix environment is controlled by your <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> and <b>SHELL</b> variable settings.</p>
<p>When you log on to any Unix/Linux system, Unix automatically sets a number of important environment and shell variables. Depending on which shell you are running, you can use the 'set' and/or 'setenv' commands on the command line to see these variables. Environment variables from your initial login are copied to each subshell that you open during that login session, but shell variables are not. Environment variable names are all upper case by convention, while shell variables are all lower case by convention.</p>
<p>The whole point of environment and shell variables is to store critical information that your applications rely on. For example, one of the most important environment variables is the PATH variable. The PATH variable holds the directories that are searched for application programs and their components, in the order of importance. If you have an application program or a program component that is in a directory that is NOT in your PATH, then the Unix system will be unable to find it if it is not in your current directory.</p>
<p>To illustrate, say you PATH variable is set to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">PATH=/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/:/usr/ucb:/usr/local/bin</p>
<p>and you wish to execute the XYZ application that is installed in the directory:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">/var/bin/XYZ</p>
<p>Unless you are in the directory XYZ from command prompt, the Unix system will not be able to find your XYZ application.</p>

<h2><a name="change-environment"></a>Can I change my CSIL Linux/UNIX environment?</h2>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>See the shell commands that are applicable for viewing and editing your default and preferred command shell environment and shell variables. You can almost always override the pre-set defaults that we have set up for you.</p>
<p>For example, if your default Unix command shell is 'bash', you could search the internet for web pages that match phrases like: 'setting bash environment variables'.</p>

<div class="">
<h2><a name="file-storage"></a>Where to save my files on CSIL Linux/UNIX systems?</h2>
<p>One and only one place: <b>/home/<i>username</i>/sfuhome/</b></p>
<p>For Unix/Linux users in CSIL, your home directory is set to /home/<i>username</i>/ by the system. This space is actually not located on any physical workstation in CSIL, but is automatically mounted for you at login time from a file server. This way, no matter which Linux/Unix machine in CSIL that you log in to, you will have the same /home/<i>username</i>/ directory. Note that this is NOT the place to save your files. You should save files to your SFU Campus home directory, which is mounted as</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>/home/<i>username</i>/sfuhome/</b></p>
<p>Your CSIL /home directory is local to the CSIL network and may be ERASED without advanced notice. If you wish to save any of the files and directories you create while in CSIL on a permanent basis, you should save them to your SFU Campus home directory.</p>

<h2><a name="access-sfuhome"></a>How do I access SFU Campus home directory?</h2>
<p>When you log in to CSIL linux, it is automatically mounted as /home/<i>username</i>/sfuhome &nbsp;in your CSIL home. If for some reason it is not mounted, you should see a file called "@_This_IS_NOT_your_real_sfuhome_README.txt" in the placeholder sfuhome/ directory. Open a terminal session from Applications accessories on Gnome panel, and enter the command</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>mount.sfuhome</b></p>
<p>If that still does not mount your SFU home, please email helpdesk about it, with the name of the linux machine and any error messages, and please try another linux machine.</p>

<h2><a name="check-storage-usage"></a>How to check my space usage on a CSIL Linux/UNIX system?</h2>
<p>Due to resource limitations, a quota is set on each user's storage space. If the quota is reached for a user, there are undesirable consequences, including inability to log on to the CSIL linux GUI and possible data loss.</p>
<p>The quota for your&nbsp;<b>SFU home</b>&nbsp;is 10GB (gigabyte) as of March 2016. You may find the current quota information about <b>SFU homes</b>&nbsp;<a href="/itservices.html">on the IT Services site</a>.</p>
<p>The quota for your<b>&nbsp;CSIL home</b>&nbsp;is 2GB (gigabyte) as of March 2017. &nbsp;This space is meant only for cache and other system files, not your own work, which should be in the SFU home.</p>
<p>To see exactly how much space you're using, login to a CSIL linux system:</p>
<ul>
<li>ssh to a CSIL linux system (see&nbsp;the <a href="#remote-access-linux-system">remote access section</a>)&nbsp;, OR</li>
<li>login to a CSIL linux workstation<br>
→ if you fail to login at the GUI screen, press the key combination <b>Ctrl-Alt-F1</b> to switch to a <b>Virtual Console&nbsp;</b>where you should still be able to login. <b>Remember to log out of it!</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Once logged in with your account, check if your quota is exceeded with the command:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>quota -v</b></p>
<p>You should see your storage usage information.</p>
<p>To know more about which directories use the most storage, use this command at the linux prompt:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>du -sh &nbsp;~/* &nbsp;~/.??* | sort -n</b></p>
<p>This lists the files and directories (folders) in your CSIL home directory (that's what "~" means in the command above, aka profile folder) invluding your mounted SFU home space, sorted by the amount of space they occupy.</p>
<p>Note how much space the "sfuhome" folder occupies - if this number is close to the quota, please archive some of your files to other locations (not your CSIL home) and clean out some space.</p>
<p>You may also use the following commands at the linux prompt:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>cd<br>
 find . -size +10M -ls</b><br>
</p>
<p>This shows files larger than 10MB. Remove any such files you no longer need.</p>

<h2><a name="share-files"></a>How do I share files with other Linux/UNIX users?</h2>
<p>You can share files <b>publicly</b>, <b>semi-publicly</b>, to a <b>group</b>, or to a <b>specific list</b> of Unix users.</p>
<h4>Sharing files Publicly</h4>
<p>Create a directory in your home directory which is eXecutable and Readable by all. The goal of this is to let every Unix user list the file names in your directory without letting any other users write anything to your directory. Each file that you store in this directory should be readable by everyone, but likewise should not be writeable. For your directory then, enter the commands:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">mkdir public<br>
chmod a+rx public<br>
chmod go-w public</p>
<p>This creates the sub-directory 'pub' in the current directory. Next, you can create files in this directory, and change their permissions to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">chmod a+r [one or more filenames]<br>
chmod go-w [one or more filenames]</p>
<h4>Sharing files Semi-Publicly</h4>
<p>The goal here is similar to the above instructions, but here you create a directory in your home directory which is eXecutable but NOT Readable or Writeable by either the 'group' or 'others'. This approach prevents other Unix users from listing the names of your files within your directory unless you tell them the file names. This presumably prevents them from listing or copying your file's contents. This solution however has two big security holes. It is known as "Security through obscurity", and is therefore NOT SECURE. If any other Unix user can guess your directory's "hidden" file names, or someone who knows the names passes them on to other users, they can read or copy your files, just like users you do give your file names to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">mkdir semi_public<br>
chmod a+x semi_public<br>
chmod go-rw semi_public</p>
<h4>Sharing files with a Group</h4>
<p>Here the goal is to share files only with the Unix group. For undergraduate students in CSIL this isn't terribly helpful, as every undergraduate student taking a CMPT course is in the same group:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">mkdir group_files<br>
chmod o-rwx group_files<br>
chmod g-w group_files<br>
chmod g+rx group_files</p>
<h4>Sharing files with a SpeCific List of Unix Users</h4>
<p>This is not available on all Unix systems, but is available on the Ubuntu systems in CSIL. This facility is known as Access Control Lists (ACLs), and these are set via the <b>setfacl</b> command. You can view the currently set ACL for a file or directory with the <b>getfacl</b> command. Check the man pages on your system or search the Web for tutorials on how to set ACLs. Here is a simplistic example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">mkdir secret_files<br>
setfacl -m mask:rwx secret_files<br>
setfacl -m user:[allowed_userid]:r-x secret_files</p>
<p>To see your ACL settings enter:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">getfacl secret_files</p>

<h2><a name="remote-access-linux-system"></a>How do I remotely access (remote login) CSIL Linux (Ubuntu) systems via ssh?</h2>
<p>1. To access the <a href="unix/how-to-use-csil-linux-cpu-server.html">CSIL Linux CPU server</a>: from any secure shell client, enter the full name of <u>one of our CSIL CPU servers</u> as hostname and use <b>port 24</b> , and SFU Connect credentials. e.g.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">ssh -p <b>24</b> <b>csil-cpu2.cs.surrey.sfu.ca</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Please check out our <a href="unix/how-to-use-csil-linux-cpu-server.html">CSIL Linux CPU server FAQ page</a> for more servers info!</p>
<p>2. To access a CSIL Ubuntu workstation: from any secure shell client, enter <b>fraser.sfu.ca</b> as hostname, and SFU email password as password. After successful login, enter one of the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">ssh -p <b>24</b> <i>linux_machine</i>.csil.sfu.ca</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">ssh -p <b>24</b> <i>linux_machine</i>.cs.surrey.sfu.ca</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Note: the <i>linux_machine</i> is the hostname of a CSIL Linux workstation.</p>
<p>Please note: all of CSIL workstations dualboot Ubuntu with Windows. When a workstation is booted to Windows, it won't accept SSH connections; you may try another workstation, or better, use our <a href="./unix/how-to-use-csil-linux-cpu-server.html">CSIL Linux CPU Server.</a> For workstation names, please check <a href="/content/dam/sfu/computing/csil/csil_layout_burnaby.pdf">CSIL Burnaby layout</a> and <a href="/content/dam/sfu/computing/csil/CSIL_Layout_Surrey.pdf">CSIL Surrey layout</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="install-software"></a>May I install software for my course work on a CSIL workstation?</h2>
<p><b>No</b>.</p>
<p>Your account will be suspended if you attempt installing software in CSIL without permission.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for this policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>The School is responsible for the licensing of all installed software in the lab. Many applications that are downloadable from the Internet aren't free - they require licenses.<p>Installing licensed software without a valid license is a criminal offence in Canada.</p>
</li>
<li>Many applications make assumptions about where they place their files during the installation process and which environment variables they adjust. Installing software which makes unexpected assumptions can destroy your working environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could make requests for the installation of course related applications (including shareware/freeware) through the instructors. Your instructors will make the request to the CS Technical Staff, who will examine the feasibility of all requests (cost, compatibility, network security, disk space requirements, etc.). Please make your requests as early as possible.</p>

<p>All of the Linux workstations in CSIL are now providing a "roaming profile" - which means that <u>the user's desktop and program settings will follow the user</u> between the workstations.</p>
<p>The switch depends on user authentication against SFU Active Directory on those Linux workstations. If you could not login to these Linux workstations binding to ADSFU, please do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">change your password<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">wait for 15 minutes</p>
<p>This process ensures SFU AD could recognize your account from Linux. You may try to login after the wait.</p>

<p>&nbsp;rcg-nfs02.its.sfu.ca:/csilhomes&nbsp; 500G&nbsp;&nbsp; 13G&nbsp; 488G&nbsp;&nbsp; 3% /cs/ugrad</p>
<p>If this line (the numbers may be a little different) exists, you are using roaming profile.</p>
<p>If you noticed that you are not using the roaming profile, please <a href="../how-to-contact-helpdesk.html">email helpdesk</a>.<br>

<h2><a name="software-eclipse-00"></a>How do I run Eclipse?</h2>
<p>When you launch Eclipse for the first time, you need to specify the workspace path. The default is something like this and it is <b>WRONG!</b><u><br>
</u></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">/home/<i>username</i>/workspace<br>
</p>
<p>As you can see, it is not on the SFU Home.<br>
<br>
The following folder is the best workspace for all CSIL users:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>/home/<i>username</i>/sfuhome/eclipse/workspace</b></p>
